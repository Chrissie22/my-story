 Documenting git Basics.

*What Version Control is: A "time machine" for your code.

*git init: To start tracking a new project.

*git add: To stage your changes (put them in the "shopping cart").

*git commit -m "message": To create a permanent save point.

*git log: To view the history of your save points.

*git remote add origin [YOUR_REPO_URL]

*git remote -v: -v stands for vaerbose and it will show you the nickname (origin) and the url it points to.

*git push -u origin master: the -u is shorthand for --set-upstream
